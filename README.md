## Project
Given a static dataset (JSON) of camp Features, design and implement a feature set page that displays all features, sub-features of a campsite, and their respective availability. Sub-features are revealed upon click of the primary feature. Availability can be toggled upon click of a button next to the feature.

----
## Assumptions
1. Sub-features can still be available even in the primary feature is not.
2. Although this is a smaller scoped project, I implemented a Rails back end that will allow for future capabilities that relate to the persistence of the data.

----
## Technology
* Rails API 
* React front end 

##How to run it
`$ rails start`
